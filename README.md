# Specifying The Make Target

The program didn't run and compile the my-program target at first because when we type "make" it will only compile the first target. However, if we specify which target to make, it will run and compile that specific target we chose.

# Default Target - My Explanation

Yes, my program ran this time because we set the lol-haxx target to be dependent upon the my-program target. Since lol-haxx is the first target declared, we can type "make" with no arguments and still have my-program execute and compile.
